Basic concepts of Java

## What did I learned in this course?

I learned the basic concepts of the Java language, basic concepts of Classes and methods, data types, variables, basic statements

## How is this repository structured?
Since this is a simple basic knowledge course I added both the module code along files as well as the excersises, they´re just simple run time 
results, each with it´s main class.
